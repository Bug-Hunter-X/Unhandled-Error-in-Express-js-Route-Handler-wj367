# Unhandled Error in Express.js Route Handler
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that's vulnerable to errors when an invalid user ID is provided. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug Description
The original code lacks error handling for scenarios where the provided `userId` is invalid (e.g., not found in the database, improperly formatted). This can result in unexpected application behavior, including crashes or internal server errors.

## Solution
The solution involves adding comprehensive error handling using try...catch blocks or middleware to gracefully handle invalid inputs and return appropriate responses (e.g., 404 Not Found) to the client.
